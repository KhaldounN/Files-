# Weather Prediction 
 Weather Prediction 


this is a group project for students in Barcelona technology school. 

the idea is to use KNeighborsClassifier to predict weather (rain level , temprature, claud level).

if you input a date that program will search in the database for the information about the last 7 days and create prediction based on it .
